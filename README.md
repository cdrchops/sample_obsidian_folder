This is a quick sample of how I put together my index pages... this isn't a superb example.  To use this just copy the TEMP file into your obsidian vault.

The first example [[DrugsIndex]] is using dataview for a Drugs Index page.  I have a folder with all of the drugs I either need to remember, want to remember, and/or are going into a book I'm writing.  The data is pretty straight forward and uses tags in the body to be able to show in a dataview table.

The second example [[Research Index]] is how you can organize your research according to common headings.  Not all of the headings need to be used and you can have some notes with more headings.  This is how I will sometimes start piecing together information to write a paper.  I have also used atomic notes for this, I haven't mastered that and so I don't use it as often as I could.

The third example [[Research Index 2]] is how you can make notes about specific elements and bring them together into one note.  I might use this method if I'm just mad dashing through some research items or I find something that looks interesting, but I don't have enough for a full topic.  Maybe the 1st page contains some images of a VIIC and maybe the 2nd page contains some images of a IX.  Those pages may actually aggregate in a dataview the other elements.
